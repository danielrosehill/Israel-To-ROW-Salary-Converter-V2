Generate a Streamlit app that will be deployed onto Streamlit Community Cloud.

The functionality of this app is to convert between salaries as they are expressed in Israel (New Israeli Shekels per month) And as they are expressed in other countries. 

The app should convert from Israeli salaries to salaries in the in the following currencies; Euro, USD, GBP. These should be represented by the flags of the EU, USA, and the UK respectively. 

The app should use up to date foreign exchange rates for the conversions. 

The app should have tabs, displayed along a top navigation bar: Israel To ROW and ROW to Israel

In the Israel to ROW tab:

The user should select an Israeli salary. For the purpose of this app, these salaries should range from 7000 to 60,000 shekels and be selectable in increments of 1,000.

Try to come up with an imaginative UI for selecting the Israeli salary. I like the idea of a dial, so long as it's easy enough for the user to control. If possible, have both a UI selection element as well as a text box where the user can simply enter the salary conventionally. The text box could function with up and down arrows which increment and decrease the salary by 1000 shekels.

Beneath the Israeli salary is the converted world salary. 

The formula for converting Israeli salaries to world salaries is as follows: Israeli salary x 12 x exchange rate.

For example, if the Israeli Shekel to USD exchange rate is 0.28 and the Israeli salary were 10,000, the formula applied would be 10,000*12*0.28 which = $33,600.

The salary conversions should happen in real time and each currency should be converted to. 

The second tab is the opposite functionality. It allows the user to input a salary in either Euro dollars or sterling and it will work back to the Israeli salary. 

The formulae will be the reverse: dividing by 12 and then applying the exchange rate. 

For example, if the user were trying to convert a salary of $50,000 USD and USD:ILS was at 3.55 the formulae applied would be 50,000/12*3.55 = 14792 ILS

In all cases, the converted salaries should be expressed to the nearest integer. No decimal places should ever be shown. 

You can add the following text to the footer:

This calculation app for converting between salaries in Israel, the rest of the world was developed by Daniel Rosehill (danielrosehill.com) prompting Sonnet 3.5.

Ensure that the project structure is suitable for deployment onto Streamlit Community cloud.
